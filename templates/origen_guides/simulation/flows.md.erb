Now if you run this:

origen g my_pat_1 my_pat_2
it will run them sequentially as separate simulations, creating two waveforms named after each pattern.

To get the previous behavior of combining them into a single simulation you now need to add a --flow option:

origen g my_pat_1 my_pat_2 --flow my_flow
This will simulate the given patterns back-back and dump them to a waveform named after the flow option, in this case "my_flow".

Program generation works the same as before, but now the generated wave will be named after the flow and not called 'origen'.
