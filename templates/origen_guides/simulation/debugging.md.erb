reg.sync



Added an API to allow application code to force a simulation fail, which piggy backs on the way that log output from the simulator can make the simulation result be classed as a fail:

# When running in simulation, verify this node which is not observable on the tester
if tester.sim?
  if tester.simulator.peek("origen.dut.path.to.some.node").to_i == 1
    OrigenSim.error "The internal blah warning was asserted!"
  end
end

% end
