By convention, the OrigenSim simulator driver is configured within the file `environment/sim.rb`.

Usually the simulator configuration may be different for each DUT target, so often this file is structured like this
to enable a single Origen simulation environment setup file to support multiple DUT targets within the
application:

~~~ruby
# environment/sim.rb

case Origen.target.name

when "my_dut1"
  OrigenSim.cadence do |sim|
    # Configuration of Cadence simulator to be used for DUT1 here
  end

when "my_dut2"
  OrigenSim.synopsys do |sim|
    # Configuration of Synopsys simulator to be used for DUT2 here
  end

else
  Origen.log.error "No simulation environment has been setup for target #{Origen.target.name}, edit environment/sim.rb to add one."
  exit 1
end
~~~

#### Configuring The Simulator

Here is an example of configuring the simulator with some generic options that are supported by all simulators:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.cadence do |sim|
  # By default a simulation will be given 60 seconds to startup, if it fails to start within this time the
  # simulation will be abandoned and considered failed. If a particular simulation is known to be slow to start,
  # the timeout can be extended as shown in this example (5 minutes):
  sim.startup_timeout 5 * 60
  # Abort the simulation when this number of errors is reached (defaults to 100).
  # This can also be overridden at runtime via the --max_errors switch.
  sim.max_errors = 50
end
~~~

Note that defining a configuration like this will also instantiate an instance of `OrigenSim::Tester` and assign it to
the global variable `tester`.
This `tester` object will behave like any other Origen tester driver and your application will be unaware that it is
driving a simulator rather than an ATE-specific pattern renderer.

Note also that the `post_process_run_cmd` option is available for all simulators, however it is reserved for discussion
later in this guide since it is more of an advanced topic.

#### Cadence (irun) Specific Configuration

Additionally, a Cadence simulator setup supports the following vendor-specific options:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.cadence do |sim|
  # By default the simulation will be run by calling 'irun', this can be changed to anything you want, but it
  # is usually a good idea to use this option to lock to a specific version of irun (the same version that was
  # used to compile the DUT snapshot)
  sim.irun '/tools/cadence/15.10.023/bin/irun'
  # The default wave viewer is 'simvision', this can also be changed
  sim.simvision '/tools/cadence/15.10.023/bin/simvision'
  # The cadence simulator configuration does support the use of forces, though this is generally discouraged
  sim.force {
    'origen.dut.vref_0v8' => 1,
    'origen.dut.pmc.some.internal.node' => 1,
  }
  # Custom probes can be specified, e.g. to include memory contents in the wave dump
  sim.tcl_inputs %Q(
    probe -create -shm origen.dut.mems.user -all -memories -variables -unpacked 262144 -depth all
    probe -create -shm origen.dut.mems.cache -all -memories -variables -unpacked 262144 -depth all
  )
end
~~~

#### Synopsys Specific Configuration

Here are the vendor-specific options for Synopsys:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.cadence do |sim|
  # By default the simulation will be run by calling 'vcs', this can be changed to anything you want, but it
  # is usually a good idea to use this option to lock to a specific version of vcs (the same version that was
  # used to compile the DUT snapshot)
  sim.vcs "/tools/synopsys/L-2016.06/bin/vcs"
  # The default wave viewer is 'dve', this can also be changed
  sim.dve "/tools/synopsys/L-2016.06/bin/dve"
end
~~~

Origen Sim also offers the option to use Verdi as a wave viewer instead of 'dve', the vendor-specific options for Synopsys w/Verdi would be: 

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.cadence do |sim|
  sim.vcs "/tools/synopsys/L-2016.06/bin/vcs"
  sim.verdi "/tools/synopsys/L-2016.06/bin/verdi"
end
~~~

#### Icarus Verilog Specific Configuration

Here are the vendor-specific options for Icarus Verilog:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.cadence do |sim|
  # By default the simulation will be run by calling 'vvp', this can be changed to anything you want, but it
  # is usually a good idea to use this option to lock to a specific version of vvp (the same version that was
  # used to compile the DUT snapshot)
  sim.vvp "/tools/icarus/0.9.7/bin/vvp"
  # The default wave viewer is 'gtkwave', this can also be changed
  sim.gtkwave "/tools/gtkwave/3.3.66/bin/gtkwave"
end
~~~

#### Custom Simulator Configuration

A custom simulator configuration allows you to use a tool that is not supported out of the box by <code>OrigenSim</code>,
or to setup a more advanced simulation run command such as that required to run an analog-digital co-simulation if your
DUT contains full electrical models of some IPs.
For these, it 
is your responsibility to provide the command to start the simulation process, however, this allows for arbitrary commands to
start the process and allows end users to still use <code>origen g</code> as if with a fully <code>OrigenSim</code> supported
simulator configuration.

An example of such a configuration could be:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.generic do |sim|
  sim.generic_run_cmd do |s|
    # Return the command to start the simulation
    "path/to/custom/sim/script +socket+#{s.socket_id}"
  end
end
~~~

Here is an example using the predecessor of the supported Cadence tool <code>irun</code>, <code>ncsim</code>:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.generic do |sim|
  sim.testbench_top 'na_origen'
  sim.generic_run_cmd do |s|
    "ncsim na_origen -loadpli origen.so:origen_init +socket+#{s.socket_id}"
  end
end
~~~

The following commonly used options are available to a generic simulation configuration:

* `testbench_top` - Defines the testbench name if different from <code>origen</code>.
* `view_waveform_cmd` - Required for generic configurations - prints out this statement following a simulation instructing the
user on how to open the waveforms for viewing. For supported simulators, this is already provided, but can be overwritten.
* `generic_run_cmd` - Either a string, array to be joined by ' && ', or a block returning either of the aforementioned that
the generic configuration will use to launch the simulation.
* `post_process_run_cmd` - Block object to post-process the command that OrigenSim will launch the simulation with. This can be used
to post-process the command for any supported vendor. This block should return the command to run, as a string.

An example of the <code>post_process_run_cmd</code> usage is:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.cadence do |sim|
  sim.post_process_run_cmd do |cmd, s|
    # cmd is the current command that will be run. s is the simulator object, same as sim in this case.
    # this should return either a string or an array to be joined by ' && ' (chain commands)
    # note that we must RETURN the string. We cannot just edit it.
    
    # add an environment variable and run setup script as an example
    return "export PROJECT=my_rtl && source #{Origen.app.root.join('settings.sh')} && #{cmd}"
    
    # or, we could return
    return [
      'export PROJECT=my_rtl',
      "source #{Origen.app.root.join('settings.sh')}",
      cmd
    ]
    #=> "export PROJECT=my_rtl && source #{Origen.app.root.join('settings.sh')} && #{cmd}"
  end
end
~~~

#### Simulation Object Checkin/Checkout

Environment setups can also include information on the url and version of where the compiled simulation object
is to be stored - often this will not be checked into the same repository as the main application code since
for example Git, which is good for application code storage, is not really so good for storing large binaries
like the simulation objects.

Here is an example setup:

~~~ruby
OrigenSim.synopsys do |sim|
  sim.rc_dir_url 'sync://sync-12345:12345/Projects/origen_sim_snapshots'
  sim.rc_version 'Trunk'
end
~~~
  
The `rc_dir_url` option should point to a directory in the repository where the snapshot files should be
stored, not to the snapshot file itself.

The `rc_version` can be set to the version to use, which can be a pointer to latest like 'Trunk' or 'master' or
to an absolute version.

The object should be committed to the repository by running the `origen sim:ci` command with the environment/target
setup to select the object to be checked in.
Origen Sim will then automatically tar up the object and check it in.

This same command can be run again in future to check in new versions.

Origen Sim will then automatically check for the presence of the object in the local workspace and will fetch
it as required - i.e. if not present or if the `rc_version` has been updated.

Note that when a latest pointer is used as the version, the remote repository is not automatically checked for updates.
If you want to fetch the latest version or force a re-checkout at anytime you can run the `origen sim:co` command.

% end
