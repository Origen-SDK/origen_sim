OrigenSim is a plugin that enables semiconductor test patterns (and flows) written in Origen/Ruby to be run
in a dynamic Verilog simulation, similar to what is commonly known as a _Virtual Test_ simulation in other workflows.

It provides a simulation tester driver (which can be used as a direct replacement for Origen's
conventional ATE tester drivers) which will
pass requests to drive or expect pin values onto a simulator instead of rendering them to an ASCII file. Since
the application-level Origen code is the same in both cases, it guarantees that what happens in the simulation
and in the final pattern are the same and that ultimately they will work first time on silicon.

For debugging, OrigenSim supports the injection of regular Ruby debugger breakpoints anywhere in the pattern
source code. This will halt the simulation at the given point in time, allowing it to be interactively
debugged at the Origen-source-code level.

Similarly, an Origen interactive session (`origen i`) can be launched with an OrigenSim driver,
allowing designers and test engineers to use Origen APIs to interactively manipulate a live simulation of their
DUT while viewing the response in real time in a wave viewer.

#### Adding OrigenSim To Your Application

To enable your application to use OrigenSim, simply add the plugin to your Gemfile:

~~~ruby
gem "origen_sim"
~~~

and then [create a simulation environment setup](<%= path "guides/simulation/environment" %>).
